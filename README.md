##  Languages
I mostly just learn the ones that interest me, the only exception being PHP,
which I hate, but which I must use to get anything done.
I'll give links for the less common languages.

C   
*[Amiga Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga)*, [Autocoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocoder), [IBM 1401 Machine Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401)  
*Python*  
HTML, CSS, *Javascript*, PHP  
***Lua (used to be fluent)***

Languages marked in *italics* are languages which I'm not fluent in,
but which I have used and may relearn easily.
