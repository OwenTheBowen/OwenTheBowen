#       **Greetings, Human!**
####    *You've found me!*

I've not got very much to say.

This is my profile I guess. [Visit my website.](http://ow.earthquake-site.com)
I mostly do coding for fun. I do take requests from my friends when they need anything done, but I like coding things as a hobby.

Currently working on `SAGE`, can't say what it is yet.

##  Languages:
I mostly just learn the ones that interest me. The only exception is `PHP`.
I'll give links for the more uncommon languages.

C, C++, C#  
[Amiga Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga), [Autocoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocoder), [IBM 1401 Machine Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401)
Python, [TI-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series)  
HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP  
Lua, [Lua-U](https://luau-lang.org)  
[Windows Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file)

Can't think of any others that I know.

##  Contact Information
You can try to ask me for help on something, but unless you just want a small bit of code for your project or to know how to solve a problem, you're out of luck.
